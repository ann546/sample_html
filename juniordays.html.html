<h1 style="text-align: center; ">My Junior high school Days</h1>
<h2style>My junior high school day is my most favorite phase in my life, I have a lot of experience both good and bad
My I found a lot of new friends, I have a bad and good influence friends we did a lot of staffs that sometimes I forgot may academics, and it didn't help my performance at school, I was part of dance  troupes 
I really enjoyed, I fell in love in dancing that it leads me to forgot how very important my academic is, but I realized it with the help of my family, friends and teachers, I realized that having a to keep on doing my passion and academic practically is a good tandem I enjoy and learn at the same time, I started getting more involved in extracurricular activities like sports and student council. I also started taking on more challenging subjects and began studying harder. I had a great group of friends and we would hang out after school, go to the mall or just goof around. Although, I do remember those days being a bit more stressful as the workload increased. But it was a great time for personal growth and development.
but suddenly I lost my passion tell now because of the pandemic, I got drain because I feel so alone and I feel like I'm stuck at the same routine everyday, I always overthink about the future, and that's leads me lose my desire in all aspects, but did I tell why that is my favorite phase of my life despite the tragedy that happened because of the pandemic, I love that phase of my life my junior high school life, not just because I got the time for my family it is because I have so many realization, specially how important the time is, how important learning and finding some experience in outside home is very important, being stuck at home
 is not easy, its has a lot of restrictions specially in achieving your goals and dream.
