<h3>My elementary school years were both educational and enjoyable. 
My favorite subject in art class was drawing and painting, which I would do for hours on end. During recess, 
I also liked to play hide-and-seek or tag with my friends. And every day I eagerly anticipated seeing 
my amazing group of friends. Because I play a lot and don't have many worries to worry about, 
elementary school is a lot of fun. The school activities are what I remember most from elementary school as a girl scout, I gained a lot of
knowledge about independence, responsibility, and having unique survival abilities. 
In addition, I joined the Supreme Student Government as a Public Information Officer. I truly appreciated the opportunities that the organization provided, and I'm glad I did. All in all, I had a great time in elementary school.
